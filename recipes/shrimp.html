      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chile hot sauce (such as Cholula®)</li>
      <li>2 pounds large peeled, deveined raw shrimp</li>
      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2/3 cup cornmeal</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
